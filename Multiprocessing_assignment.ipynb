    "1.Multiprocessing->Multiprocessing in Python is a built-in package that allows the system to run multiple processes simultaneously. It will enable the breaking of applications into smaller threads that can run independently. The operating system can then allocate all these threads or processes to the processor to run them parallelly, thus improving the overall performance and efficiency.  \n",
    "Multiprocessing is useful because performing multiple operations for a single processor becomes challenging. As the number of processes keeps increasing, the processor will have to halt the current process and move to the next, to keep them going. Thus, it will have to interrupt each task, thereby hampering the performance.That's why multiprocessing becomes essential as it is easier to manage different processes."
